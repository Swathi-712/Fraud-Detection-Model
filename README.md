# Fraud Detection Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project completed for the Accredian Fraud Detection Assignment (August 2025). It features a Random Forest Classifier to predict fraudulent transactions on a dataset with over 6 million rows, achieving an ROC AUC greater than 0.9.

## Key Highlights
- Data cleaning with outlier removal and multi-collinearity handling
- Model development using SMOTE for class balance and feature ranking (e.g., 'amount', 'type_TRANSFER')
- Performance evaluation with ROC AUC, confusion matrix, and visualizations

## Technologies
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, imblearn
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook
